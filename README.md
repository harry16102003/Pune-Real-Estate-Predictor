# 🏥 Healthcare Patient Readmission Analysis

An end-to-end **Data Science and Business Intelligence** project focused on analyzing patient readmission data.  
This project implements a full pipeline—from data ingestion and analysis to predictive modeling and interactive visualization—to deliver actionable insights into healthcare operations.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A comprehensive 4-page Power BI dashboard for exploring patient demographics, clinical factors, and model performance.  
- **Live Prediction App**: A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that uses a trained XGBoost model to predict patient readmission risk in real-time.  
- **Data-Driven Analysis**: Based on a detailed analysis of a real-world healthcare dataset in a Jupyter Notebook.  
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Demonstrates the full data science lifecycle from ingestion to deployment.

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning**: Loaded and preprocessed CSV data in Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new variables like `is_readmitted`, `age_diagnoses_interaction`.
3. **Model Training**: Used XGBoost Classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
4. **Deployment**: Model saved with `joblib` and integrated in Streamlit app.
